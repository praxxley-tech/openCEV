# CVE Alert System

The CVE Alert System is a Python-based application designed to automate the monitoring and notification of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) based on reports fetched from a specified API. It processes each report to extract CVE details and sends out alerts for each identified CVE.

## Features

- Fetching CVE reports from a REST API.
- Basic Authentication for secure API access.
- Processing and extracting detailed information from each CVE report.
- Sending formatted CVE alerts via a custom notification service.
- Avoiding duplicate notifications for already processed CVEs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests library
- Access to a Unix-like command-line interface for curl commands

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

    git clone <repository-url>

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and install the required Python libraries:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 3: Configuration

Edit the script to include your specific API endpoints, authentication credentials, and other configurations:

- Replace http://<server-ip>:8000/api and http://<server-ip>/restAPI with your actual API and notification endpoints.
- Replace <username> and <password> with your actual authentication credentials.

Ensure that these sensitive details are securely stored and not hard-coded in the script for production environments.

## Usage

To run the CVE Alert System, execute the script from your command-line interface:

    python cve_alert_system.py

The script will automatically:

1. Fetch the list of CVE reports from the configured API endpoint.
2. Process each report to extract and format CVE details.
3. Send out a notification for each CVE, ensuring no duplicates are sent.

### Alert Format

Notifications are sent with the following format:

ðŸš¨ CVE Alert: CVE-XXXX-XXXX ðŸš¨
Title: <Title of the CVE>
ID: <Report ID>
CVE: <CVE ID>
Score: <CVSS Score>
Summary: <CVE Summary>

## Security and Privacy

Ensure to handle authentication credentials and sensitive information with care:

- Avoid hard-coding credentials directly in the script.
- Use environment variables or secure vaults to manage sensitive information.
- Regularly update and rotate credentials.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date.
- Verify network connectivity to the specified API and notification endpoints.
- Check for correct authentication credentials and endpoint configurations.
- For detailed error logs, consider implementing logging within the script.
